This is a placeholder respository for a long-term project to create a custom 68k sound driver and accompanying C libraries for advanced real-time sound design and playback on the Sega Saturn console. This is very early in the pre-design phase and will be a very complex project, if I determine that what I'm envisioning is feasible on the hardware.

Major goals include full MIDI I/O support, full control over the SCSP sound chip's slots that can be saved as patches to an SD card on an ODE, real-time manipulation of sounds to enable creating music and complex multi-slot sounds that can be played back on the hardware without needing a devkit, and the ability to take saved patches and sequences and import them easily into a homebrew game.

More information to come.
